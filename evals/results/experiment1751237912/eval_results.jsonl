Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted   Providers   One of the important considerations when choosing a health insurance plan is   understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers. When   you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally   cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an   out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs.   Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you   will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best   value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between   in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs.    In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to   provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the   amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the   cost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer   additional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers.     Out-of-Network: Out-of-network providers are those who have not contracted with   Northwind Health.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: For example, if   your provider’s charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the   remaining $100 balance billing amount.   Exceptions   There are certain exceptions to the rule of non-participating providers. Your health plan   may cover emergency services provided by non-participating providers, as well as certain   services provided by non-participating providers that are not available from participating   providers. Additionally, in some cases, the health plan may cover non-participating   providers’ charges if there are no participating providers in your area.   Tips   In order to avoid costly balance billing amounts, it is important to make sure that your   provider is a participating provider in your Northwind Standard health plan. If you are   unsure, you can contact the customer service department of your health plan to verify.      It is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find   out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill   you after the health plan pays them.   When selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating   providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some   providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services.   Finally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check   with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service.   Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about   the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.

Non-Participating   Non-Participating Providers and How They Affect Your Costs   When selecting a health care provider, it is important to understand the differences   between participating and non-participating providers. Participating providers are those   who have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard health plan’s set rates. Non-  participating providers are those who have not agreed to accept the set rates and can   charge the patient more than what the health plan pays.   When you choose a non-participating provider for your healthcare services, you may be   responsible for paying the difference between the provider’s actual charges and the amount   the plan pays. This difference is known as the balance billing amount. Depending on your   provider’s policy, you may be required to pay the balance billing amount up front. Be sure to   discuss this with your provider prior to receiving services.   Additionally, it is important to note that if you use a non-participating provider, your out-of-  pocket costs may be higher than if you had used a participating provider.

COB Definitions   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   At Contoso, we want our employees to understand the concept of COB (Coordination of   Benefits) so they can make the best decisions when it comes to their health care coverage.   COB is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more   than one health plan.   When an employee has multiple health plans, the health plan that pays first is determined   by the order of benefit determination. Generally, the employee's primary health plan pays     first, followed by the secondary health plan. However, if one of the health plans is a   Medicare or Medicaid plan, that plan pays first.   Under the Northwind Standard Plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the   network providers and services that are covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost.   However, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind   Standard network will not be covered by the plan.   When you receive health care services, it's important to identify all of your coverage to the   provider to ensure that they bill each health plan appropriately. This helps to ensure that   you receive the full benefits offered by each plan. If you do not identify all of your health   coverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.   When you submit a claim to Northwind Standard, you'll need to include information about   the other coverage you have. If the claim is sent to Northwind Standard before any other   plan, the claim will be processed based on the Northwind Standard plan benefits.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: Health Care Plans   It may be possible to coordinate benefits with other health care plans if you have other   coverage. Coordinating benefits allows you to receive payments from each health plan   towards covered services, as long as the total amount of payments does not exceed the total   charges for the service.    If you have other coverage, such as Medicare or an employer-sponsored health plan, the   Northwind Standard plan may be able to coordinate benefits with those plans. This can help   reduce your out-of-pocket costs for health care services.    How Do I Coordinate Benefits with Other Plans?     If you have other health care coverage, you should contact the other health care plan(s) to   determine how to coordinate benefits. Depending on the plans you have, you may be able to   coordinate benefits by filing a claim with both plans.    You will need to provide the other plan with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB)   from the Northwind Health plan. The EOB is a summary of the services you received and   how much the Northwind Health plan paid for those services.    When filing a claim with the other health care plan, you may also need to provide a copy of   your bill or invoice. The other plan may require additional information as part of the claim   process.    You should keep copies of all documentation that you submit to the other plan. This can   help you track your claim and follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in   processing.    Exceptions   Coordination of benefits with other plans is not available for all types of services. For   example, coordination of benefits will not be available for services related to emergency   care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, or services received from out-of-  network providers.    Tips for Coordinating Benefits   • Contact your other health care plan to determine whether you can coordinate benefits and   what documentation you need to provide.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: will pay   first; the secondary plan will pay what the primary plan does not.   If you have other coverage, you must notify Northwind Health of any changes in your   coverage status or any changes in any of your other coverage. If you fail to do so, you may be   responsible for any charges that Northwind Health would have paid if you had notified   them of the other coverage.   In certain circumstances, you may be able to keep your other coverage and still be eligible   for coverage under the Northwind Standard plan. However, if the other coverage is primary,   you will be responsible for any charges that would have been paid by the Northwind   Standard plan.   It is also important to note that if you have coverage through a government-sponsored   program such as Medicare or Medicaid, you may be subject to certain restrictions.

However,   in order to get the most out of their benefit coverage, employees should be aware of the   prior-authorization process for certain services and treatments.   Prior-authorization is a process in which Northwind Health requires Contoso's employees   to get approval from their plan before receiving certain services or treatments. This process   helps ensure that the care is necessary and medically appropriate. If prior-authorization is   not obtained, the employee may be responsible for the full cost of any services or   treatments that are received without approval.   Some services or treatments that may require prior-authorization include, but are not   limited to, hospital stays, certain medical procedures, durable medical equipment, and   certain prescription drugs. In order to obtain prior-authorization, the employee's physician   must submit a request to Northwind Health. The request will then be reviewed by   Northwind Health to determine if the service or treatment is medically necessary and if it is   a covered benefit under the Northwind Standard plan.   In some cases, Northwind Health may also require that the employee meet certain criteria   in order to be approved for a service or treatment. These criteria may include specific   medical tests or treatments, lifestyle changes, or other requirements. If the employee is   unable to meet the criteria, prior-authorization may not be granted.   There are some exceptions to the prior-authorization process.

Continuity of Care   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Continuity of Care   It’s important to understand continuity of care when selecting a provider. Continuity of care   is the process of being treated by the same provider or medical team over a period of time.   When you have continuity of care, your provider has a better understanding of your medical   history, enabling them to provide more accurate diagnoses and treatments.   Continuity of care is important when selecting a provider because it ensures better quality   of care. When you have continuity of care, your provider is more familiar with your medical   history, which can lead to more effective treatments. Also, if you stay with the same   provider for a period of time, the provider will be more likely to know about any changes in   your health and can offer more personalized care.

Clinical Review   CARE MANAGEMENT – Clinical Review   Northwind Health Plus offers several care management services to ensure that members   are receiving the best possible care.

Clinical Review involves a team of healthcare professionals who review services,   treatments, and medications to ensure that they are medically necessary and appropriate   for the individual’s condition. The review team may also look at other factors, such as cost   and effectiveness, to ensure that the care provided is in line with established standards.   Clinical Review is available for all care services covered by Northwind Health Plus. This   includes preventive care, primary care, specialty care, and hospital services. Clinical Review   is also available for services provided by out-of-network providers.   In some cases, Clinical Review may result in a denial of coverage for certain services and   medications.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf: able to continue   seeing them without having to switch to a different provider in the network.

However,   in order to get the most out of their benefit coverage, employees should be aware of the   prior-authorization process for certain services and treatments.   Prior-authorization is a process in which Northwind Health requires Contoso's employees   to get approval from their plan before receiving certain services or treatments. This process   helps ensure that the care is necessary and medically appropriate. If prior-authorization is   not obtained, the employee may be responsible for the full cost of any services or   treatments that are received without approval.   Some services or treatments that may require prior-authorization include, but are not   limited to, hospital stays, certain medical procedures, durable medical equipment, and   certain prescription drugs. In order to obtain prior-authorization, the employee's physician   must submit a request to Northwind Health. The request will then be reviewed by   Northwind Health to determine if the service or treatment is medically necessary and if it is   a covered benefit under the Northwind Standard plan.   In some cases, Northwind Health may also require that the employee meet certain criteria   in order to be approved for a service or treatment. These criteria may include specific   medical tests or treatments, lifestyle changes, or other requirements. If the employee is   unable to meet the criteria, prior-authorization may not be granted.   There are some exceptions to the prior-authorization process. For example, preventive care   services and emergency services are not subject to prior-authorization. In addition, mental   health and substance abuse coverage is not subject to prior-authorization. However, out-of-  network services are subject to prior-authorization and may require additional cost to the   employee.

At Northwind Health, we understand that there are times when care is not available   through an in-network provider. That's why we make exceptions to the prior-authorization   requirement for certain services and procedures.

Clinical Review   CARE MANAGEMENT: Clinical Review   The Northwind Standard plan offers a variety of care management services to help ensure   that members receive quality, cost-effective care. These services include clinical review,   which is a process that evaluates the medical necessity and appropriateness of a proposed   course of treatment, as well as any adjustment or changes to existing treatments.   Clinical review is conducted by Northwind Health’s Medical Management Department,   which is staffed by licensed clinicians who are experienced in the various medical   conditions and treatments that are covered by the Northwind Standard plan. These   clinicians use evidence-based guidelines and other important criteria to evaluate the   proposed course of treatment and make sure that it is medically necessary and appropriate.

Emergency Room   COVERED SERVICES - EMERGENCY SERVICES   At Contoso, we understand that unplanned medical emergencies can arise, and so our   insurance partner, Northwind Health, provides coverage for emergency services. This   coverage applies to both in-network and out-of-network providers.    In-Network Providers   If you seek emergency care from an in-network provider, your plan will cover the cost of   treatment, including any necessary hospitalization and follow-up care. Depending on the   type of plan you have, you may also be responsible for paying a copayment and/or   coinsurance.    Out-of-Network Providers   Emergency services received from out-of-network providers will also be covered, but you   may be responsible for higher out-of-pocket costs such as copayments and coinsurance. If   you receive services from an out-of-network provider, you may also be responsible for   paying the difference between the amount billed by the provider and the amount the plan   will pay.    Exceptions     Northwind Health Plus does not cover certain types of emergency services. These include   services for certain social and cosmetic procedures, elective surgery, experimental   treatments, and services for injuries or illnesses that are not medically necessary.    Tips for Employees   It is important to keep in mind that if you have an emergency, you should seek care from the   nearest hospital or medical facility.

Your in-network urgent care provider should be   able to tell you what your costs will be before you receive any services.   Out-of-Network Coverage   If you receive care from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for a higher   cost-sharing amount than if you had visited an in-network provider. You will also be   responsible for any additional costs, such as lab tests and x-rays, that you receive from an   out-of-network provider.

Tips for Seeking Urgent Care   When you need urgent care, it is important to remember that not all urgent care facilities   are the same. Here are some tips to help you make the best decision for your situation:     • Do your research: Before you visit an urgent care facility, be sure to research the facility to   make sure it is in-network.    • Make sure the facility is open: Always double-check the hours of operation for the facility   you plan to visit.    • Have your insurance card on hand: Bring your insurance card with you to the visit, as you   may need to provide it to the facility.    • Bring your medical records: If you have any relevant medical records, bring them with you   to the facility. This will help the provider make a more informed diagnosis.    • Know when to go to the emergency room: If you are experiencing a medical emergency,   call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room for treatment.   We understand that receiving urgent care can be a stressful situation.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf: Year Deductible   The Northwind Health Plus plan has a calendar year deductible that applies to some   services. The amount you must pay out-of-pocket before the plan begins to pay for covered   services is called the calendar year deductible. The calendar year deductible is the same for   all members of the plan and is reset each year on the plan's renewal date.    For In-Network Services: The calendar year deductible for in-network services is $1,500 for   individuals and $3,000 for families. This means that you must pay the full cost of all covered   services until you have paid a total of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. Once   this amount is reached, the plan will begin to pay its share of the cost of eligible services.    For Out-of-Network Services: The plan does not have a calendar year deductible for out-of-  network services. However, out-of-network services are subject to higher cost sharing than   in-network services, so be sure to check with your provider to find out the cost sharing that   applies.    Exceptions: Certain services are exempt from the calendar year deductible. These services   include preventive care services and emergency services.

IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION   Copayments (Copays)   IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays)   When using Northwind Health Plus, you may be responsible for a copayment (or copay) for   certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you are expected to pay for a service.   The amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the   service is rendered by an in-network or out-of-network provider, and other factors.    In-Network Copays:    For in-network services, copayments are generally lower than for out-of-network services.   The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $20, while specialist visits have a   copayment of around $50. For in-network emergency services, the copayment is typically   around $100. In addition, for in-network preventive care services, there is typically no   copayment.    Out-of-Network Copays:    For out-of-network services, copayments are typically higher than for in-network services.   The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $50, while specialist visits have a   copayment of around $75.

Please note that Northwind Health Plus will only cover a portion of   out-of-network services, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance.    Exceptions:    There are a few exceptions to the copayment amounts listed above. For example, for mental   health and substance abuse services, the copayment for in-network services is typically   around $30 and the copayment for out-of-network services is typically around $60. In   addition, the copayment for preventive care services is typically waived if received from an   in-network provider.    Tips:    It is important to remember that copayments are subject to change and may vary depending   on the type of service received. It is also important to note that copayments are not waived   for out-of-network services, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance after   Northwind Health Plus has paid its portion.    Finally, it is important to make sure that the provider you are seeing is in-network. This can   be easily done by checking the provider directory on the Northwind Health Plus website. It   is also important to remember that if you receive a service from an out-of-network   provider, you may be responsible for a higher copayment.

Knowing whether you are visiting a primary care physician, specialist, or mental   health provider will help you to understand how much your copay will be. Your copay   amount will be listed on your insurance card.    When you visit a doctor, you should also inform the office staff that you are a Northwind   Health Plus member. This will ensure that the staff bills your insurance correctly and that   you are charged the correct amount for your copay.    If you have any questions about your copay amount, you can contact Northwind Health's   customer service team. They will be able to provide more detailed information about your   coverage and copay amount.    It is important to remember that the split copay only applies to office visits. Other services,   such as lab tests, X-rays, and imaging tests, are subject to different copay amounts, which   are listed on your insurance card.    It is also important to remember that the split copay only applies to in-network providers. If   you visit an out-of-network provider, you will be subject to a higher copay amount, which is   also listed on your insurance card.    At Northwind Health Plus, we are committed to helping our members get the care they need   at a price they can afford. With the split copay for office visits, we hope to make healthcare   more affordable for you and your family.

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans   If you have other health care coverage, such as Medicare or a health plan from another   employer, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Coordinating   benefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination   helps to ensure that you don’t pay more than you should for your health care.   When coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the   first plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays   second is called the secondary plan.

IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION   Copayments (Copays)   IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays)   When using Northwind Health Plus, you may be responsible for a copayment (or copay) for   certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you are expected to pay for a service.   The amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the   service is rendered by an in-network or out-of-network provider, and other factors.    In-Network Copays:    For in-network services, copayments are generally lower than for out-of-network services.   The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $20, while specialist visits have a   copayment of around $50. For in-network emergency services, the copayment is typically   around $100. In addition, for in-network preventive care services, there is typically no   copayment.    Out-of-Network Copays:    For out-of-network services, copayments are typically higher than for in-network services.   The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $50, while specialist visits have a   copayment of around $75. For out-of-network emergency services, the copayment is   typically around $150.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: person, per year. This means that you will need to pay   the first $2,000 of your medical expenses before the plan will begin to cover the remaining   amount.    Co-payments and Co-insurance   Once you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for co-payments and co-  insurance. Co-payments are a fixed amount that you will need to pay at the time of service,   while co-insurance is a percentage that you will need to pay. For Northwind Standard, the   co-payment is $30 for primary care visits and $50 for specialist visits. The co-insurance is   20% of the remaining cost after the deductible has been met.    Out-of-Pocket Maximum   The out-of-pocket maximum for Northwind Standard is $6,000 per person, per year. This is   the maximum amount that you will need to pay for your medical expenses in a given year.     Once you have reached this limit, the plan will cover 100% of your expenses for the   remainder of the year.    Tips for Managing Your Costs   There are several steps that you can take to help manage your costs when you are enrolled   in Northwind Standard. Here are a few tips that you can use to get the most out of your   coverage:    • Make sure to take advantage of preventive care services. These services are covered 100%   by the plan and can help you avoid more costly treatments down the line.    • Always make sure to visit in-network providers. Doing so will ensure that you receive the   maximum benefit from your plan.    • Consider generic prescription drugs when available.

Many doctors are willing to work with you   to find the most cost-effective treatment options available.    • Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements carefully.

By understanding how to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus and other health   care plans, you can make sure that you are getting the most out of your health care   coverage.    COB Definitions   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   The term “Other Coverage” is defined as any other insurance, health plan, or other coverage   which provides benefits and services for medical care that is also provided under the   Northwind Health Plus plan. This includes, but is not limited to, Medicare, TRICARE,   Medicaid, employer-sponsored plans, and government-sponsored plans.

This means that Northwind Health Plus coordinates its   benefits with the Other Coverage in order to ensure that you receive the maximum amount   of benefits available to you.

To understand how COB works, it is important to understand the following terms:   • Primary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits first.   • Secondary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits after the Primary Coverage   has paid out its benefits.   • Crossover Claims: These are claims that are submitted to both the Primary Coverage and   the Secondary Coverage at the same time.

Clinical Review   CARE MANAGEMENT: Clinical Review   The Northwind Standard plan offers a variety of care management services to help ensure   that members receive quality, cost-effective care. These services include clinical review,   which is a process that evaluates the medical necessity and appropriateness of a proposed   course of treatment, as well as any adjustment or changes to existing treatments.   Clinical review is conducted by Northwind Health’s Medical Management Department,   which is staffed by licensed clinicians who are experienced in the various medical   conditions and treatments that are covered by the Northwind Standard plan. These   clinicians use evidence-based guidelines and other important criteria to evaluate the   proposed course of treatment and make sure that it is medically necessary and appropriate.     Northwind Health utilizes a three-level clinical review process. The first level of review   involves a Registered Nurse (RN) or Medical Doctor (MD) evaluating the proposed course of   treatment.

There are a few tips you can follow to ensure you are taking full advantage of continuity of   care and are getting the best, most affordable care possible. First, be sure to always keep   your provider information up to date. If you move or change providers, be sure to notify   your insurance company right away. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, be   sure to check with your provider to understand any associated costs. Finally, if you are   switching providers or insurance plans, make sure you get copies of your medical records   from your previous provider.   At Contoso, we strive to provide our employees with access to quality, affordable health   care. We are proud to offer Northwind Standard, an insurance plan that provides continuity   of care, helping you to receive the best possible care and save money on health care costs.   Non-Participating   Non-Participating Providers and How They Affect Your Costs   When selecting a health care provider, it is important to understand the differences   between participating and non-participating providers. Participating providers are those   who have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard health plan’s set rates. Non-  participating providers are those who have not agreed to accept the set rates and can   charge the patient more than what the health plan pays.   When you choose a non-participating provider for your healthcare services, you may be   responsible for paying the difference between the provider’s actual charges and the amount   the plan pays. This difference is known as the balance billing amount. Depending on your   provider’s policy, you may be required to pay the balance billing amount up front. Be sure to   discuss this with your provider prior to receiving services.   Additionally, it is important to note that if you use a non-participating provider, your out-of-  pocket costs may be higher than if you had used a participating provider.

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans   If you have other health care coverage, such as Medicare or a health plan from another   employer, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Coordinating   benefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination   helps to ensure that you don’t pay more than you should for your health care.   When coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the   first plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays   second is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its   allowed amount for the services you received. The secondary plan then pays the difference   between what the primary plan paid and the total cost of the services.

This will help you avoid any surprise costs.    • Take advantage of preventive care services when they are offered. These services are   covered at no cost to you and can help you stay healthy.    • Be aware of your plan’s formulary, which is a list of medications that are covered by your   plan.

COB Definitions   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   At Contoso, we want our employees to understand the concept of COB (Coordination of   Benefits) so they can make the best decisions when it comes to their health care coverage.   COB is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more   than one health plan.   When an employee has multiple health plans, the health plan that pays first is determined   by the order of benefit determination. Generally, the employee's primary health plan pays     first, followed by the secondary health plan. However, if one of the health plans is a   Medicare or Medicaid plan, that plan pays first.   Under the Northwind Standard Plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the   network providers and services that are covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost.   However, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind   Standard network will not be covered by the plan.   When you receive health care services, it's important to identify all of your coverage to the   provider to ensure that they bill each health plan appropriately. This helps to ensure that   you receive the full benefits offered by each plan. If you do not identify all of your health   coverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.   When you submit a claim to Northwind Standard, you'll need to include information about   the other coverage you have. If the claim is sent to Northwind Standard before any other   plan, the claim will be processed based on the Northwind Standard plan benefits.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf: a timely manner.   COB's Effect On Benefits   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? - COB's Effect On Benefits   When you have more than one health insurance policy, the policies coordinate benefits   through a process called Coordination of Benefits (COB). Coordination of Benefits is a   process that helps to determine which plan pays first when there are multiple health plans     available. This process is important because it affects how much you will pay out-of-pocket   for care.   When Northwind Health Plus is the primary insurance (the plan that pays benefits first),   any other insurance you may have will become the secondary insurance and only pays   benefits if there are unpaid charges from the primary plan. However, if Northwind Health   Plus is the secondary plan, then it pays benefits after the primary plan has paid its share.   The amount Northwind Health Plus pays for a covered service depends on the coverage of   the primary plan and the total amount charged for the service. Northwind Health Plus may   pay up to the amount of the maximum allowable charge, which is the maximum amount the   plan pays for a service.   If you have more than one health insurance policy, you may need to provide proof of the   other coverage, such as an insurance card or a letter from the other insurer, to verify which   plan is primary and which is secondary.   When you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus   insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the   benefits correctly.   When you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus   insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the   benefits correctly. It is important to note that Northwind Health Plus does not coordinate   benefits with Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE programs.   When coordinating benefits, there are a few important exceptions to keep in mind. If you\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: plan has a $1,000   deductible and Northwind Standard has a $500 deductible, only the $500 deductible from   the primary plan will be paid.   There are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules. For instance, if you have   Medicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind   Standard will be the secondary coverage. However, if you have Medicare Part D for   prescription drugs, Northwind Standard will be the primary coverage and Medicare Part D   will be the secondary coverage.   It’s also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to   provide evidence of that coverage to your health plan. This is known as “creditable   coverage,” and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses   once the primary plan has paid.

COB's Effect On Benefits   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? - COB's Effect On Benefits   When you have more than one health insurance policy, the policies coordinate benefits   through a process called Coordination of Benefits (COB). Coordination of Benefits is a   process that helps to determine which plan pays first when there are multiple health plans     available. This process is important because it affects how much you will pay out-of-pocket   for care.   When Northwind Health Plus is the primary insurance (the plan that pays benefits first),   any other insurance you may have will become the secondary insurance and only pays   benefits if there are unpaid charges from the primary plan. However, if Northwind Health   Plus is the secondary plan, then it pays benefits after the primary plan has paid its share.   The amount Northwind Health Plus pays for a covered service depends on the coverage of   the primary plan and the total amount charged for the service. Northwind Health Plus may   pay up to the amount of the maximum allowable charge, which is the maximum amount the   plan pays for a service.   If you have more than one health insurance policy, you may need to provide proof of the   other coverage, such as an insurance card or a letter from the other insurer, to verify which   plan is primary and which is secondary.   When you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus   insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the   benefits correctly.

Additionally, you   may need to consider other payment sources, such as private insurance, flexible spending   accounts, or state or federal programs.     Finally, it is important to understand the plan's coverage limits and to keep track of all out-  of-pocket expenses. You should also be aware of your plan's annual deductible and   coinsurance amounts.

Under the Northwind Standard Plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the network providers and services covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost. It's important to identify all of your coverage to the provider to ensure proper billing and to receive full benefits. When COB applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible expenses, and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost. For example, if a medical bill is $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the secondary payer will pay the remaining $200.

COB's Effect On Benefits   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   When you have other health insurance coverage, coordination of benefits (COB) can affect   how your benefits are paid. COB is a process where your insurance companies coordinate   who pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical   expenses. The insurance company that pays first is called the primary payer, and the   company that pays second is called the secondary payer.   Coordination of Benefits Exceptions   There are a few exceptions to COB rules that may apply to you. If you are covered by   Medicare, Medicaid, or a veterans’ health plan, Northwind Standard may pay first, even if\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: first, even if   the other plan is usually the primary payer. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a plan that is   required by law to coordinate benefits, such as an employer-sponsored plan, Northwind   Standard may pay first.   Understanding How COB Affects Your Benefits   When COB applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible   expenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost. Depending on the type of   service, the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses. When this happens, the   secondary payer may pay nothing.     For example, if you receive a medical bill for $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the   secondary payer will pay the remaining balance of $200. However, if the primary payer   pays the full $1,000, the secondary payer will not pay anything.   Tips for Working with COB   When you have multiple health insurance plans, it’s important to understand how COB   works and how it can affect your benefits. Here are a few tips to help you manage your   benefits:   • Make sure that each insurance company has all of the necessary information about your   other coverage, including plan numbers and policy dates.   • Confirm that your primary and secondary payers have updated information about each   other.   • Ask your health care providers to submit claims to both insurance companies.   • Understand any limitations or exclusions that may apply to your benefits.   • If you have questions, contact each insurance company for clarification.   Overall, it’s important to understand how COB works and how it affects your benefits. By   being aware of the rules and exceptions, you can ensure that you are getting the full   coverage you need from both insurance companies.

COB Definitions   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   At Contoso, we want our employees to understand the concept of COB (Coordination of   Benefits) so they can make the best decisions when it comes to their health care coverage.   COB is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more   than one health plan.   When an employee has multiple health plans, the health plan that pays first is determined   by the order of benefit determination. Generally, the employee's primary health plan pays     first, followed by the secondary health plan. However, if one of the health plans is a   Medicare or Medicaid plan, that plan pays first.   Under the Northwind Standard Plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the   network providers and services that are covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost.   However, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind   Standard network will not be covered by the plan.   When you receive health care services, it's important to identify all of your coverage to the   provider to ensure that they bill each health plan appropriately. This helps to ensure that   you receive the full benefits offered by each plan. If you do not identify all of your health   coverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.

In order for the coverage to be effective, the attending physician must provide written   certification that the mastectomy was medically necessary. The certification should include   a description of the medical condition, the type of mastectomy performed, and the type of   reconstructive surgery required. The attending physician must also certify that the   mastectomy was performed for medical reasons and not for reasons of cosmetic   enhancement.    When the attending physician provides the written certification, the plan must provide   coverage for the mastectomy and any reconstructive surgery that is required. The coverage   must include all stages of reconstruction, prostheses, and other supplies related to the   reconstruction. The plan must also provide coverage for physical complications of the   mastectomy, including lymphedema, which is a condition that causes swelling due to a   buildup of lymph fluid in the affected area.    In addition, the plan must provide coverage for outpatient services, such as physical therapy   and counseling, that are related to the mastectomy or reconstructive surgery. The plan must   also provide coverage for ancillary services that are related to the mastectomy or   reconstructive surgery, such as ambulance services, durable medical equipment, and   prosthetic devices.    Under the WHCRA, the coverage must be provided without imposing any additional costs or   restrictions on the patient. This means that the patient should not have to pay any   additional coinsurance, copayment, or deductible for the mastectomy or reconstructive   surgery.

{"question": "How does the Coordination of Benefits (COB) process affect out-of-pocket costs when Northwind Health Plus is involved, and what role does COBRA play in maintaining health coverage after a job loss?", "truth": "The Coordination of Benefits (COB) process affects out-of-pocket costs by determining which health insurance plan pays first when multiple plans are available. If Northwind Health Plus is the primary insurance, it pays benefits first, and any other insurance becomes secondary, covering unpaid charges. Conversely, if Northwind Health Plus is secondary, it pays after the primary plan. This coordination impacts the amount paid out-of-pocket, as Northwind Health Plus may cover up to the maximum allowable charge. COBRA, on the other hand, allows employees and their families to continue their health coverage after a job loss or other qualifying event, ensuring that individuals can maintain their health insurance even when they are no longer employed. Northwind Standard complies with COBRA requirements by providing information about the right to continue coverage and its associated costs.

Therefore, I don't know about COBRA based on the given sources.", "context": "Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: Health Care Plans   It may be possible to coordinate benefits with other health care plans if you have other   coverage. Coordinating benefits allows you to receive payments from each health plan   towards covered services, as long as the total amount of payments does not exceed the total   charges for the service.    If you have other coverage, such as Medicare or an employer-sponsored health plan, the   Northwind Standard plan may be able to coordinate benefits with those plans. This can help   reduce your out-of-pocket costs for health care services.    How Do I Coordinate Benefits with Other Plans?     If you have other health care coverage, you should contact the other health care plan(s) to   determine how to coordinate benefits. Depending on the plans you have, you may be able to   coordinate benefits by filing a claim with both plans.    You will need to provide the other plan with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB)   from the Northwind Health plan. The EOB is a summary of the services you received and   how much the Northwind Health plan paid for those services.    When filing a claim with the other health care plan, you may also need to provide a copy of   your bill or invoice. The other plan may require additional information as part of the claim   process.    You should keep copies of all documentation that you submit to the other plan. This can   help you track your claim and follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in   processing.    Exceptions   Coordination of benefits with other plans is not available for all types of services. For   example, coordination of benefits will not be available for services related to emergency   care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, or services received from out-of-  network providers.    Tips for Coordinating Benefits   • Contact your other health care plan to determine whether you can coordinate benefits and   what documentation you need to provide.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf: in mind. If you   are covered by a spouse's health plan, the primary plan is usually the plan that covers the   spouse and the secondary plan is usually the plan that covers you. Additionally, if you are   covered by more than one group plan, the primary plan is usually the plan of the employer   who has the most employees.   Following these tips can help you understand how COB works and how to get the most out   of your health coverage:   • Understand the coverage of all of your health plans so that you know which plan is   primary and which is secondary.   • Contact your health care providers and make sure they are aware of all of your coverage   and that they know how to coordinate benefits.   • Keep copies of your insurance cards, letters from insurers, and other documents that   explain your coverage.   • Contact Northwind Health Plus if you have any questions or need help understanding how   COB works.     By understanding your coverage and being aware of how COB works, you can ensure that   you are getting the most out of your health plan and that you are not paying more out of   pocket than you need to.   Subrogation And Reimbursement   Subrogation and Reimbursement   Subrogation and reimbursement are two important concepts to understand when it comes   to Northwind Health Plus insurance. Subrogation is the process by which Northwind Health   Plus can seek reimbursement from another insurance company if you have secondary   medical coverage. In other words, if you have coverage through Northwind Health Plus and   another insurance provider, Northwind Health Plus may be able to recoup the costs of   medical services they paid for from the other insurance company.   Reimbursement works in the opposite way. It is the process by which Northwind Health   Plus can reimburse you for certain medical expenses that you paid for out-of-pocket. This is   beneficial if you received medical services that were not covered by Northwind Health Plus.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf: necessary. Additionally, you should review the list of excluded services and prescriptions to   ensure that you are not seeking treatment for an excluded service or prescription.    If you are considering a medical service or treatment that is not covered under the plan, you   should discuss payment options with your doctor or healthcare provider. Additionally, you   may need to consider other payment sources, such as private insurance, flexible spending   accounts, or state or federal programs.     Finally, it is important to understand the plan's coverage limits and to keep track of all out-  of-pocket expenses. You should also be aware of your plan's annual deductible and   coinsurance amounts.    By understanding Northwind Health Plus's exclusions and following the tips outlined above,   you can ensure that you are receiving the most comprehensive coverage available under the   plan and avoid any unexpected costs.   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans   If you have other health care coverage, such as Medicare or a health plan from another   employer, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Coordinating   benefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination   helps to ensure that you don’t pay more than you should for your health care.   When coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the   first plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays   second is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its   allowed amount for the services you received.

This means that if your primary insurance covers the   services that you received, Northwind Health Plus will not seek reimbursement.   When it comes to reimbursement, there are certain exceptions to Northwind Health Plus’s   policy. For example, Northwind Health Plus will not reimburse you for any medical services   that were covered by another insurance provider. Additionally, Northwind Health Plus will   not reimburse you for any medical services that you received from an out-of-network   provider, unless the service was deemed medically necessary and was not available from an   in-network provider.   Finally, it is important to remember that Northwind Health Plus may require that you   submit certain documentation in order to receive reimbursement. This documentation may   include itemized bills, proof of payment, and/or medical records.   In order to ensure that you are able to take full advantage of Northwind Health Plus’s   subrogation and reimbursement policy, it is important to keep detailed records of all   medical services that you receive.

Balance Billing Protection   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Balance Billing Protection   Balance billing is a practice where a provider bills you for the difference between the   allowed amount and billed amount. The allowed amount is the amount that your insurance   company determines is a reasonable fee for a service. The amount you are billed for is the   amount that the provider charges you for the services. With Northwind Health Plus, you are   protected from balance billing. This means that you can rest assured that you will not be   billed more than the allowed amount by your provider.    Balance billing protection is an important part of Northwind Health Plus. This protection   ensures that you will not be responsible for the difference between the allowed amount and   the billed amount. This protection helps you to avoid unexpected costs.    Exceptions:     Balance billing protection does not apply to out-of-network providers. If you receive   services from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the difference   between the allowed amount and the billed amount.    Balance billing protection also does not apply to certain services, such as cosmetic services   and experimental procedures. If you are considering receiving any of these services, it is   important to check with Northwind Health Plus to determine whether balance billing   protection applies.   Tips:   1. Get preauthorization: When you are planning to receive a service, it is important to get   preauthorization.

How Prior-Authorization Works   CARE MANAGEMENT: How Prior-Authorization Works   Prior authorization is a process that Northwind Standard uses to help ensure that members   receive medically necessary, cost-effective, and appropriate services. With prior     authorization, services must be approved by Northwind Health before you can receive   them. This process helps ensure that members receive the right care at the right time.   There are certain services that require prior authorization before the service is rendered.   These services can include, but are not limited to, hospital stays, certain laboratory tests,   certain imaging services, physical therapy, and durable medical equipment. Northwind   Health may also require prior authorization for drugs that are not on the Northwind   Standard formulary.   When you or your doctor request a service that requires prior authorization, Northwind   Health will review the request. Northwind Health will then decide if the service is medically   necessary and covered under Northwind Standard. Northwind Health will notify you and   your doctor of the decision within three business days.    If Northwind Health approves the service, you may receive the service without any   additional pre-authorization. However, if Northwind Health denies coverage, you may be   able to appeal the decision. You can contact Northwind Health by phone or mail to submit   an appeal.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: services.    Prior Authorization is a process used by Northwind Health to make sure that a covered   service is medically necessary and is the most cost-effective way to receive the service.   Before certain services are approved and covered, an authorization must be requested from   Northwind Health. This authorization can be requested by either the provider or the   member.    If you require a service that requires prior authorization, you must make sure that it is   requested and approved before you receive the service. If prior authorization is not   obtained, Northwind Health may not cover the service.    Exceptions   There are certain services that are exempt from the prior authorization process. These   include:    - Preventive care services, such as annual physicals or vaccinations      - Services provided in an emergency care setting    - Services provided in an outpatient hospital setting    - Services provided in an urgent care setting    - Services provided in a skilled nursing facility    Tips   If you have any questions about the prior authorization process, Northwind Health   recommends that you contact them at least five business days before the scheduled service.   This will allow you to receive the necessary authorization in a timely manner.    You can contact Northwind Health by calling their customer service number or sending an   email. If you call, make sure to have your health plan identification number handy.    Additionally, if you receive a service without prior authorization, you may be responsible   for the full cost of the service.

However,   in order to get the most out of their benefit coverage, employees should be aware of the   prior-authorization process for certain services and treatments.   Prior-authorization is a process in which Northwind Health requires Contoso's employees   to get approval from their plan before receiving certain services or treatments. This process   helps ensure that the care is necessary and medically appropriate. If prior-authorization is   not obtained, the employee may be responsible for the full cost of any services or   treatments that are received without approval.   Some services or treatments that may require prior-authorization include, but are not   limited to, hospital stays, certain medical procedures, durable medical equipment, and   certain prescription drugs. In order to obtain prior-authorization, the employee's physician   must submit a request to Northwind Health. The request will then be reviewed by   Northwind Health to determine if the service or treatment is medically necessary and if it is   a covered benefit under the Northwind Standard plan.   In some cases, Northwind Health may also require that the employee meet certain criteria   in order to be approved for a service or treatment. These criteria may include specific   medical tests or treatments, lifestyle changes, or other requirements. If the employee is   unable to meet the criteria, prior-authorization may not be granted.   There are some exceptions to the prior-authorization process. For example, preventive care   services and emergency services are not subject to prior-authorization. In addition, mental   health and substance abuse coverage is not subject to prior-authorization. However, out-of-  network services are subject to prior-authorization and may require additional cost to the   employee.
